Project Summary: Analyzing Reservation Cancellations in Resort and City Hotels

Objective:
The primary goal of this data analysis project was to investigate and understand the patterns of reservation cancellations in both resort hotels and city hotels. The project aimed to identify factors contributing to higher cancellation rates in resort hotels compared to city hotels.

Data Sources:
The project utilized historical reservation data from both resort and city hotels. The dataset included information on reservations, such as booking dates, check-in dates, room types, guest demographics, and whether the reservation was canceled.

Methods:

Data Cleaning and Exploration:

The dataset was cleaned to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to gain insights into the distribution of cancellations, booking trends, and guest characteristics.
Comparative Analysis:

Reservation cancellation rates were compared between resort and city hotels.
Time series analysis was performed to identify trends and seasonality in cancellations.
Factors Influencing Cancellations:

Various features, including booking channel, lead time, room type, and guest demographics, were analyzed to identify factors influencing cancellation rates.
Statistical tests, such as t-tests or chi-square tests, were employed to assess the significance of differences.

Key Findings:

Higher Cancellation Rates in Resort Hotels:

Resort hotels consistently exhibited higher reservation cancellation rates compared to city hotels.
Seasonal variations and peak travel times were observed to impact cancellation rates differently in the two types of hotels.
Influential Factors:

Lead time and booking channels were identified as significant factors affecting cancellation rates.
Guests booking through certain channels or with longer lead times were more likely to cancel reservations, especially in resort hotels.
Recommendations:

The findings suggest a need for targeted marketing or promotions during peak cancellation periods.
Improving communication and incentives for guests with longer lead times may help reduce cancellations.
Conclusion:
This data analysis project provided valuable insights into the reservation cancellation dynamics between resort and city hotels. The identified factors can inform strategic decisions and operational improvements to mitigate cancellations, enhance guest satisfaction, and optimize revenue management in both types of hotels.
